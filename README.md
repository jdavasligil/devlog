# Devlog
A simple CLI which allows you to clock in and out, keeping track of time spent coding in a CSV.

## Usage
```
dlog <COMMAND>
```
Available commands are:
* `in` - Clocks you in.
* `out` - Clocks you out.
* TODO: `time` - Calculates the total time spent developing.
* TODO: `fix <HH:MM>` - If you forgot to clock out, this will fix the error.
